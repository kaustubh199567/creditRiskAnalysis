Overview:
•	Data Preparation: Utilize data mining techniques to extract pertinent information, undertaking essential data preprocessing tasks to ensure the quality and reliability of the dataset.
•	ML Exploration: Delve into specific machine learning algorithms – logistic regression, random forest, ML methods - to comprehend their functionality deeply. Key performance metrics will be assessed for each technique.
•	Hyperparameters Tuning: To obtain the best performance on a validation dataset, the parameters of a machine learning model are optimized.
•	Ensemble Techniques: To leverage the strengths of individual models while mitigating their weaknesses, booting technique – XGBoost, is explored.
•	Performance Analysis and Pattern Identification: A thorough comparative analysis of the performance metrics- Classification report, Accuracy, Precision and Recall - across the different ML techniques will be conducted to identify effective methods for fraud detection and to discover the relationships.
•	Imbalance Correction: To solve dataset's imbalance, certain under-sampling and oversampling techniques to be studied and employed best of it. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique will also be applied to check the imbalance, thereby enhancing the model's accuracy in fraud detection.
